## Build instruction

First make sure that the dependencies and packages on the parent [README.md](../README.md) are installed.  

To stop the previous simulation, build and start a new simulation:

```bash
./build_navigation.sh
```

(optionally) To control the infobot using keyboard:

```bash
./teleop.sh
```

To start nav2 navigation stack and start commanding the infobot to move in the map:
:

```bash
./nav2.sh
```
```bash
./commander.sh
```
